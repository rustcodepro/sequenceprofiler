# sequenceprofiler

 - This crate has the following features: fasta file should be a linear fasta and not a multi line fasta just like long-read.
 - Sequence, which allows based on the similarity of the shared unique kmers and also allows for the filtering of the sequences so that you can build a native index graph faster.
 - SequenceSeq, which allows for the sequence similarity on a sequence to next iter sequence.
 - longread: finding the origin of the kmers.Back to sequences:Find the origin of 𝑘-mers DOI: 10.21105/joss.07066. Output a table for the direct ingestion into any graphs. Outputs a sam type file with the distinct count of the kmers and can be used for the jellyfish count.Support both the genome and the longread fasta file.
 - Jellyfish: a rust implementation of the jellyfish for the counts.Outputs both the unique counts, all counts.It will produce allkmers, uniquekmers, countkmers
